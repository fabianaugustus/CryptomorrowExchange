# CryptomorrowExchange
---
The Cryptomorrow exchange is a market place where creators and collectors can buy, sell or trade NFTs (art, music, movies, literature, and more).

The exchange will also serve as a means to education the next generation on various aspects of cryptocurrencies.  This will be accomplished through various funding sources:  The NFTs sold on the exchange will be done on consignment.  The fees charged when an item is sold will go into a General fund that will be used for various aspects of the Cryptomorrow ecosystem.  One the the aspects will be the creation of games that entertain and educate players about cryptocurrencies (mining, use-cases, governance, etc.).  See Nte 1 below.

The exchange will also contain at least two escrow accounts.  One of the accounts will be the General Fund, as mentioned above.  This accouunt will provide a revenue stream to create games for the Cryptomorrow ecosystem as well as provide a means to covert in-game tokens (the Horizon (HZN) token) into tokens that can be sold or traded on various exchanges.  See Nte 1 below.
